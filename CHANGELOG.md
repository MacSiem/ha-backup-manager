# Changelog — Backup Manager

## [4.1.5] - 2026-08-28

- Isolation: Bento CSS is component-local and cannot be captured from `window.HAToolsBentoCSS` by load order.
- Isolation: persistence is now card-local, removing `window._haToolsPersistence` load-order coupling while retaining existing localStorage keys.
- Isolation: removed the document-wide sibling-card injector and every shared global escape-helper reference.
- Security: runtime values are converted to text before local escaping.
- Tests: added deterministic card-isolation regression coverage.
- UX: restored the donate footer within this card's own shadow root.
- Offline/runtime: replaced the legacy `window.Chart` loader from the retired HA Tools panel with an accessible, dependency-free HTML/CSS frequency chart.

## [4.1.3] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Removed Google Fonts CDN @import (1 occurrence(s)); now uses system font stack with Inter as the preferred locally-installed face.
- Normalized bare `font-family: "Inter", sans-serif` declarations to a complete cross-platform system stack.
- Privacy section in README: claim now matches behaviour (no CDN dependencies).

All notable changes to **Backup Manager** are documented here.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### Major
- **Split from `MacSiem/ha-tools` monorepo** into a dedicated standalone HACS plugin.
- Bundled Bento Design System CSS inline — no shared dependency required.
- Inlined `_haToolsEsc` XSS sanitizer.
- Persistence keys migrated to per-tool namespace `ha-backup-manager-…` (clean break — old data under `ha-tools-…` is **not** migrated automatically).
- Donation/support footer added to the panel.
- Cross-tool discovery banner removed; each tool stands on its own.

### Compatibility

- Home Assistant ≥ 2024.1.0
